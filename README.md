# Ball: A passion project
An Educational and Exploratory Journey in Game Development

## Introduction
Ball is the brain child of Andrew Liu and Luis Lopez. It is meant to be a fun and challenging vertical endless runner
game. It is running in Python with the PyGame library and was developed using PyCharm along with GitHub. The eventual
goal is to get the game up and running on a webserver for the entire interet to play (possibly with
the usage of a cloud platform like Microsoft Azure). But for now, it is intermittently being worked on
locally and finetuned. 

## Inspiration
One day, Andrew was reminiscing on his childhood and he had a very fond memory of a mobile 
game he played in Taiwan which was just like Ball. An endless scroller that got harder as time went
on. Then, Luis said to him, "We could totally build that, like right now."

## Planning and Research
As any developer knows, the hardest part of any project is just starting. While finding the inspiration
to start was easy, the motivation, not so much. Learning to use GitHub was hard and setting up an
environment that we could both use (as Windows and MacOS users) was also hard. We had to research 
effective PyGame programming techniques and even look up some past material from classes (a short PyGame
unit). Thankfully the PyGame community is large and the documentation is in depth.

## Development Hurdles
1. Object Collision - Finding out how objects collide, their speeds, and things of that nature is very
hard to code. We are still looking for an absolute solution or fix for object collision. For that,
there are many useful guides and already existing pieces of code we are learning from.
2. Random Obstacle Generation - Something that computers struggle with is randomness. While there are
many libraries for handling that, they're not perfect and learning to use them can be hard. Random, yet 
beat-able map generation has a whole host of issues.
3. Fairness - A game can be all random, but that would not really be fun. There needs to be some sort
of grounding for the player. And along with that, a general expectation of length and difficulty when
starting a game. We are looking for ways to make the game challenging, yet fair for any player, and
still rewarding.

## Future Plans
First, we need to get over all the hurdles that are holding us back right now and finish the game's
main functionality. From there, we must add some more life to the game (sprites, music, etc.) Finally,
we want to host the game online, even if for a short while (Cloud is expensive), so that our friends can
play it and see our work.

## About the Authors
Luis is a Computer Science student and Andrew is a Data Science student. They both currently attend the University of California - Irvine, and they share their 
aspirations in becoming software developers and data scientists, as well as their love for video games. With this project we hope to have fun and learn
some new things!
